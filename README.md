## Election Audit Summary

The script created for this analysis can be used for any election. For a national election, you could adjust the code to pull the data to determine who won each state (instead of how it currently pulls data for each county), then add another for loop to determine who won the most states, therefore determining the winner. For a county-level election, you could add another for loop to determine the votes just within each county to determine who won the election there.
